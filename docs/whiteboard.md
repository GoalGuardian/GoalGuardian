# Whiteboard
The whiteboard utilizies [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev).

We do some customizations to add custom tools which allow us to insert custom hockey rinks. Clicking the tools (the 3 vertical dots in the top left) in the top part of the whiteboard will show 4 icons which corresponds to different parts of a hockey rink. Clicking the tool then clicking in the canvas will place the rink in the canvas.
